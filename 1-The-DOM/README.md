# The DOM

JavaScript is an amazing tool. Thus far, we have learned that JavaScript can be utilized to create:
1. Classes 
2. Objects
3. Databases
4. Servers

That‚Äôs not all, Javascript can also be used to manipulate the HTML elements on your webpage. Javascript accomplishes this using the **Document Object Model**. **‚≠êÔ∏è The Document Object Model (DOM) is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web.**

JavaScript views the entire HTML document as an object, where each element can be accessed through a few methods provided by the DOM API. It then creates a model of it in the form of a tree structure in order to access a particular HTML element and perform an operation on it. A basic HTML document converted to DOM would look like:
