In this exercise, you will be expanding on your previous assignment with React Components and including React Props. You are now going to be creating 2 components, which take several properties in them. 

1. Create 2 components within the `App.js` file:
    - `Intro` should return an `h3` element with the text ‚ÄúMy name is ‚Äù followed by the value of `props.name`. You can access props as the first parameter of the component function.
    - `Main` should return a `p` element with the text ‚ÄúI have experience in ‚Äù followed by the value of `props.experience`. 
2. Render your Intro and Main components on your App component. 
    - Call the Intro and Main component twice in that order. 
    ```plaintext
    Render your components in this order: 
    Intro 
    Main
    Intro
    Main
    ```
    - Use different values for the props and watch the difference on the screen.

3. Your solution should look as follows:
